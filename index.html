<div text-align: justify>Welcome to my personal website. I am a phD candidate at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences(UCAS), China. I will share my life by this website, and I hope I can make some friends come from different countries. I like play basketball very much, although I am not very tall. My favorite basketball star is Luca Donic who's hardworking and comprehensive basketball skills inspried me. Now I live in Urumqi,China.</div>
